This game was made by Alexandros Chimonas as part of a Bachelor Thesis of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering at Maastricht University, Netherlands.

This game was created to collect data on the process of playing sudoku. The only data collected are the actions you take on the game. No personal data. Specifically the data collected are:
	* In-game time of the action taken.
	* What was the action (insertion/deletion, number/note)
	
The account created for each user is generated automatically and does not include any personally identifiable information of the user.
This data will be used for the Thesis research and then posted for open access to the public on a public repository. 

For further information/updates for the repository contact: a.chimonas@student.maastrichtuniversity.nl
